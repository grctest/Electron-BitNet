# Electron-BitNet

Attempting to run Microsoft's BitNet LLM via Electron (Sans Python)

Plan:

- Use python to prepare 1-bit models
- Package the executable files within the electron app
- Create a basic UI with a couple pages, using Astro.js + React
- Run the executable inference model via a sub process via the context bridge
